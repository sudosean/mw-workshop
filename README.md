# Github Actions Workshop

In this workshop we will utilize a tool called [super-linter](https://github.com/github/super-linter), a tool provided by github that is a combination of various linters to help validate our source code. We will use the [Closet Service](https://github.com/MensWearhouse/closet-service) repo to create our action and watch it run on our forked repository.

### Goals

 - High level understanding of Github Actions
 - Hands on implementation of an action
 - Knowledge of creating workflows and some best practices
 - Linting action implemented for closet service to help streamline code reviews

## Prerequisties

 - Fork [Closet Service](https://github.com/MensWearhouse/closet-service)
